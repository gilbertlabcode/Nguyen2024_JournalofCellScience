This is a repository for the scripts we used in our paper.
The ImageJ macro for nuclear envelope wrinkling index quantification was originally developed by Cosgrove et al.:
Cosgrove BD, Loebel C, Driscoll TP, Tsinman TK, Dai EN, Heo SJ, et al. Nuclear envelope wrinkling predicts mesenchymal progenitor cell mechano-response in 2D and 3D microenvironments. Biomaterials. 2021;270: 120662. doi:10.1016/J.BIOMATERIALS.2021.120662
We made minor changes to their macro to adapt it to our data.
